# README

This directory includes the file run_analysis.R that creates the tidy data set for the project

To use it, first, download the dataset and extract it in the same directory as run_analysis.R. You should now have a 'UCI HAR Dataset' in that directory.

In R, set the working directory to tat directory and source the run_analysis.R file. The analysis is then performed and the tidy.txt file is created in the same directory.

If you want to use the tidy dataset in R, it is contained in the 'tidy' variable.
